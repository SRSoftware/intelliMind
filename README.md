intelliMind
===========

A mindmap program for knowledge storage. With this Java program, you can create interavtive and nested mindmaps to organize your thoughts.

Intellimind is written in pure java and thus requires a java runtime environment to be installed.
To launch it, you have basically two possibilities:
* either you download the [precompiled jar](https://github.com/keawe-software/intelliMind/blob/master/jar/intelliMind.jar) file and run it with `java -jar intelliMind.jar`
* or you compile it (for example using eclipse under linux) with the following steps:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/keawe-software/intelliMind`<br>
`cd intelliMind`<br>
`git submodule init`<br>
`git submodule update`<br>
`scripts/versionupdate`
then import it in eclipse and you should be able to launch it from eclipse
